                <h3>Introduction to ROS 2</h3>
                <p>ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the development
                    of robotic applications. It provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify
                    the creation of complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    We used ROS 2 foxy distribution, but find out whether you should be using foxy or another
                    distribution
                    by checking the F1Tenth website. The first lab will have information of what distribution they are
                    using. If the F1Tenth course hasnâ€™t been updated in the past year then you will be using Foxy.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Note: ROS 2 Foxy has reached its EOL (end-of-life), and is no longer officially
                        supported,
                        however, it is still functional and it is what we use for the F1Tenth cars.

                <h3>Setting Up Your ROS 2 Environment</h3>
                <p>Here is the ROS2 foxy installation page. You should be using Linux as an OS for this; Native Ubuntu
                    or Windows subsystem for linux (wsl) work the best but a virtual machine will also work.
                    <br><br>
                    We recommend using the Debian packages method
